# LOREM IPSUM LROEM UPSUM BIPSUM IPSUM LIPSUM SICK

In the last chapter, we talked about the long and windy road that led to the unraveling of our discipline. In this chapter, we're introducing the principles and fundamentals that will reunite every part of marketing so it actually works: Marketing, Fast and Slow. Let's go!

## What is Marketing, Fast and Slow?

Marketing, Fast and Slow is a media-agnostic,cross-departmental, evidence-based framework that simplifies, codifies, and connects every part of marketing- big and small - so that it actually works. Most importantly, it’s a framework for sustainable growth. What do we mean when we say sustainable growth? This: Long-term sales growth Market share increase Deeper penetration (new customers) More profit and cash flow Reduced price sensitivity Increased loyalty/retention Sustainable growth is a dance between mental and physical availability.

That means growing share of mind with increasingly bigger parts of your total addressable market (TAM) while growing share of wallet with products, pricing, and distribution. The more doors you can open to your brand and your products, the more growth you’ll achieve for longer. Easy, right? Hah. Put another way… Nearly every business sells to a smaller section of their TAM called a serviceable addressable market (SAM).

This is the part of the market you can reasonably serve with the products, pricing, and distribution you have today. But, inevitably, every brand outgrows their SAM. For example, the startup who niches down to manage limited resources eventually outgrows their niche and needs to expand their buying pool. Consequently, sustainable growth is about reinventing your SAM, over and over again, until it becomes your TAM (or as close to it as you need). Eventually, you won’t sell to niches, subsections, channels, or regions, you’ll just sell to the market. All of it. To do that, businesses need to balance their marketing between brand building, demand acceleration, and demand capture. And that’s exactly what we’ll explore in Marketing, Fast and Slow.
